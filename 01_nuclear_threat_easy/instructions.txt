We intercepted a communication of the enemies.
They are so self-confident that they dared transmit this message in the clear!

	"Dear Secret Services,
	I, your President, have mastered the art of cryptography in just one day.
	In fact, I humbly think that I have created the perfect cipher.
	I have inserted MANY security features!
	Therefore all your further communications must be encrypted with the code you find attached to this message.
	Remember to insert your codename in the communications!
	Send me the nuclear code.
	That's an order.
	Yours truly,
	President Chad."

Please crack this so-called "perfect" cipher!
