Applied Cryptography course exercises during Unipi Cybersecurity Master's Degree

#### During-course Exercises

1. **Nuclear-Threat-Easy**
   
   One-Time-Pad exploitation by known Plaintext initial chars format "From: "

2. **Nuclear-Threat-Hard**
   
   Another One-Time-Pad exploitation done with initial chars format, this time with randomly generated parameters.

3. **Evil-Man**
   
   Last One-Time-Pad exercise exploitation, done by using the "0x88" padding used during encryption XOR operation

4. **Bank-Transfer**
   
   AES-128 (with ECB) exploitation by switching bytes block #2, which contains the amount of money sent, with block #5, which is the randomly generated transaction number.
   
   Generating the new transaction with solution.py and passing it to the verifier executable retrieves the flag.

5. **Rival-Gangs**
   
   RSA decryption generating the used private key "d" by exploiting the short prime number "n" used.

6. **ObiWan**
   
   Another RSA decryption, this time the used prime number is huge, which makes its practically useless in the modular calculation.
   
   The secret message is simply generated by computing the 1/eth root on each number contained in the .txt file, and then converting each resulting ascii number into a char.

7. **Rocker**
