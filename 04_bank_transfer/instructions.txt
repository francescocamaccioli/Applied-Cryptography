GENERATION OF EXECUTABLES

The exercise requires the generation of executables of bt_enc.cpp, bt_dec.cpp, and verifier.cpp.

These programs make use of the OpenSSL APIs. For this reason, please remember to:

1) Install libssl-dev package.
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

2) Link the OpenSSL library
g++ -o prog prog.cpp -lcrypto
